                I was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. I grew up in a poor neighborhood during a time of racial tension and violence. My parents were alcoholics, but I managed to graduate from high school and start my own upholstery business.
                At age 25, I felt called to serve God full-time. I went to college and seminary, and then planted a church in Murrieta, California.


            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
               Our church is eclectic and welcoming, and we teach the true Word of God.
                I've made many mistakes along the way, but I've never given up on my vision for the church. I'm not perfect, but I'm honest and respectful. If you're looking for a real church where you can learn about God, come to Promise.

                Hi, I'm Laura. I've been working at Promise since 2016, and I love my job! I feel rewarded serving the Lord while helping families, students, and staff at Promise. It doesn't feel like work at all.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my husband, two boys, and dog. My favorite ways to relax are watching documentaries or going to hockey games. My favorite Bible verse is Micah 6:8, which reminds me to do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God.

                I was born and raised in a Lutheran household in Orange, California. My family and I attended church every Sunday, and I went to a Lutheran school from preschool through 8th grade. After high school, I started working as an aide in the preschool at my home church. I later became a preschool teacher and eventually the church secretary.

            <p class="cs-text">
                My husband and I were also married at our home church. Two years later, we moved to the Murrieta area. I started working at Promise in 2014 as a preschool teacher, and eventually became a part-time secretary. In 2016, I took a break from working to be a full-time mom to my two daughters. I was re-hired in 2021 to serve as the secretary to Pastor Chris and the other church and school staff.
            </p>

            <p class="cs-text">
                I love my job and look forward to coming to work every day. My family and I have been members of Promise since I started working here, and we love our church family. We spend most of our extra time sharing in the fellowship events and using our God-given talents and gifts in any way we can. Our church family has its ups and downs, like any family, but we are committed to loving and serving our Lord and each other.

                Since then, I've served as Treasurer and church and school administrator. I'm honored to serve in these roles, and I believe that God has called me and my family to Promise. It's not always easy, but it's always home.
